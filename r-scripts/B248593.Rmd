# Data input

First the needed libraries are load into R / Rstudio with the `p_load` 
method found within the `pacman` package (installed previously), which installs 
packages first if they are not already installed. The Assignment instructions
paper is loaded, as it contains the codebook section, which is needed to 
understand the dataset struture.

The data is accessable through the Learn portal of the University of Edingburgh.
The dataset itself is named after a town in Massachusetts USA, which was founded
in the 17th century [@Framingham_Founding] and had a population of around 72,000 
people by 2020 with a median age of 39.1 years. Most of them have a health 
insurance, only 5,3% of the population are uninsured [@Framingham_Data]. The city 
is located on the east coast of the US, and is part of the Greater Boston area and 
surrounded by some lakes as the map shows.

![Framingham, Massachusetts (Source: MapGeo)](../meta_data/Framingham_City_Map.png)

To open the dataset `framingham_2024.csv` for import into RStudio it is read 
from the `raw_data` directory using the `pacman::p_load` method which installs 
a missing package if it is missing.

<!--
To avoid absolute paths with user names included, the `here` package is used to 
access resources relatively from the working directory.
-->

```{r input, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, include = debug_var, results = 'hide'}
library(pacman)
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggplot2, epitools, finalfit, broom, gt, here)

# Opening assessment instructions with Codebook section

# Importing the dataset

```

The [age distribution of the population (Link: Data Census)](https://data.census.gov/vizwidget?g=160XX00US2524960&infoSection=Age%20and%20Sex)
of Framingham shows not a pyramid shape, as the two largest age groups are in the
35 - 39 and 40 - 44 for men and 30 - 34 and 35 - 39 for women. @Framingham_Study
describes the used data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). They state, it 
contains people from 3 different generations (original participants, children of
them and their grandchildren). The study started in 1948 and is still ongoing and
shows risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD).

# Data checking

The data set has a total of observations (rows) `r nrow(framingham)` and 
`r ncol(framingham)` variables (columns). As the `str`
method shows, all variables are stored as numerical values of the type `double`.

```{r check, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, include = debug_var, results = FALSE}
# Checking the dataset
View(framingham)
dim(framingham)
str(framingham)

# Showing total columns count
ncol(framingham)

# Showing total rows count
nrow(framingham)

# Showing columns with missing values
missing <- colSums(is.na(framingham))

# Just showing columns with missing values
col_missing <- missing[missing > 0]

# Writing column names with value in brackets
col_missing_names <- paste0(names(col_missing), " (", col_missing, ")")
col_comma_separated <- paste(col_missing_names, collapse = ", ")
```

Reading the codebook section of the assignment instructions, the following
variables are included in the dataset:

- **sex** -> *Sex*: **1 = male, 2 = female**
- **age** -> *Age* of the participant at exam (**years**)
- **currentSmoker** *Current smoker*: **1 = Yes, 0 = No**
- **cigsPerDay** -> *Number* of cigarettes that the respondent smoked on average in one day
- **BPMeds** -> Use of *Anti-hypertensive medication* at exam: **1 = Yes, 0 = No**
- **prevalentStroke** -> Respondent had a *stroke* previously: **1 = Yes, 0 = No**
- **prevalentHyp** -> *Prevalent Hypertensive*. Subject was defined as hypertensive if 
treated or if second exam at which mean systolic was >=140 mmHg or mean 
Diastolic >=90 mmHg: **1 = Yes, 0 = No**
- **diabetes** -> Diabetic according to criteria of first exam treated or first exam 
with casual glucose of 200 mg/dL or more: **1 = Yes, 0 = No**
- **totChol** -> *Serum total cholesterol* level (**mg/dL**)
- **sysBP** -> *Systolic blood pressure* (mean of last two of three measurements) (**mm Hg**)
- **diaBP** -> *Diastolic blood pressure* (mean of last two of three measurements) (**mm Hg**)
- **BMI** -> *BMI* (**kg/m^2**) 
- **heartRate** -> *Heart rate* (Ventricular rate) (**BPM**)
- **glucose** -> *Casual serum glucose* level (**mg/dL**)
- **anyCHD** -> *Outcome: Occurrence of any Coronary Heart Disease* (Angina Pectoris, 
Myocardial infarction (Hospitalized and silent or unrecognized), Coronary 
Insufficiency (Unstable Angina), or Fatal Coronary Heart Disease: **1 = Yes, 0 = No**

The columns (variables) `r col_comma_separated` show missing values, the amount 
of missing values are listed in the brackets.

# Data preparation

As the codebook section in the instruction paper mentioned the raw data needs to
be recoded. The variables `sex`, `currentSmoker`, `BPMeds`, `prevalentHyp`, 
`diabetes` and `anyCHD` are transformed to factors. The levels of the `sex` 
variable are changed to `male` and `female`, the levels of all other variables
are changed to `No` and `Yes`. 

```{r prepare, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Transforming 7 categorical variables into factors
framingham_df <- framingham %>%
  mutate(
    sex = factor(sex, labels = c("male", "female")),
    currentSmoker = factor(currentSmoker, labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    BPMeds = factor(BPMeds, labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    prevalentStroke = factor(prevalentStroke, labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    prevalentHyp = factor(prevalentHyp, labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    diabetes = factor(diabetes, labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    anyCHD = factor(anyCHD, labels = c("No", "Yes"))
  )

# Viewing the dataframe
View(framingham_df)

# Cleaining up the environment
rm(framingham, missing, col_missing, col_missing_names)
```

No further processing is needed. The processed data is stored in the variable 
`framingham_df`.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## 1.
### a. 
First I created a contingency table to see the distribution of the `anyCHD`
variable. The distribution of the dependent variable (anyCHD) is shown in the
left column of the table. The smoking status (currentSmoker), which is the
independent variable, is shown in the top row of the table. The table shows the 
number of participants in each combination of the two variables.

A barplot will be used to visualize the distribution of the `currentSmoker`
variable in relation to the occurrence of any Coronary Heart Disease as it 
displays the frequency distribution of this categorical variable.

```{r explore_1_a, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Contingency table
framingham_df %>%
  select(anyCHD, currentSmoker) %>%
  table()
```

Both groups (smoking and non smoking) are nearly the same size.

### b. 
To observe the relationship of age (2 categories) and anyCHD are shown in a 
contingency table. The occurence is shown by column of the age (numerical) 
where the first row shows the not existing CHD, the second exisiting CHD.

A barplot will be used to visualize the distribution of the `currentSmoker`
variable in relation to the occurrence of any Coronary Heart Disease as it 
displays the frequency distribution of this categorical variable.

```{r explore_1_b, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, include = debug_var, results = FALSE}
# Creating crosstab
crosstab_age <- framingham_df %>%
  select(age, anyCHD)

# Contingency table
crosstab_age %>%
  table()

# Viewing crosstab
View(crosstab_age)
```

```{r explore_1_b2, echo = TRUE, message = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Range of age
crosstab_age %>%
  select(age) %>%
  range()

# Mean and Median of the age variable
crosstab_age %>%
  summarise(
    age.mean = mean(age),
    age.median = median(age)
  )

# Summarising of age in relation to anyCHD
crosstab_age %>%
  summary_factorlist(
    dependent = "anyCHD", explanatory = "age",
    column = FALSE, total_col = TRUE
  )
```

The summarisation shows that the mean age of individuals with any coronary heart 
disease is 52.7, which is higher than the mean age of individuals without any 
coronary heart disease (48.9). This suggests that individuals with any coronary 
heart disease are generally older than those without any coronary heart disease.

```{r explore_1_b3, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Recoding age into 2 level factor (40-59, 60-79)
crosstab_age_cat <- framingham_df %>%
  filter(age >= 40) %>%
  mutate(age_cat = cut(age,
    breaks = c(39, 59, 79),
    labels = c("40-59", "60-79")
  )) %>%
  select(anyCHD, age_cat)

# Contingency table
crosstab_age_cat %>%
  table()

# Viewing crosstab
View(crosstab_age_cat)
```

That created the `crosstab_age_cat` table containing the age in two category
groups.

## 2.
### a. 
Checking the data for a relation of systolic blood pressure (sysBP) and
smoking.

```{r explore_2_a, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, include = debug_var, results = FALSE}
# Creating crosstab
crosstab_sysBP <- framingham_df %>%
  select(currentSmoker, sysBP)

# Contingency table
crosstab_sysBP %>%
  table()

# Viewing crosstab
View(crosstab_sysBP)
```

```{r explore_2_a2, echo = TRUE, message = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Range of sysBP
crosstab_sysBP %>%
  select(sysBP) %>%
  range()

# Mean and Median of the sysBP variable
crosstab_sysBP %>%
  select(sysBP) %>%
  summarise(
    sysBP.mean = mean(sysBP),
    sysBP.median = median(sysBP)
  )

# Summarising of smoking status in relation to sysBP
crosstab_sysBP %>%
  summary_factorlist(
    dependent = "sysBP", explanatory = "currentSmoker",
    column = FALSE, total_col = TRUE
  )
```

The range of the systolic blood pressure is between 83 and 295 mm Hg. The mean
133 mm Hg, and the median 129 mm Hg. For smokers the mean is 130 mm Hg and for 
non-smokers 136 mm Hg.

### b.

Investigating relations between prevalence of Hypertension and smoking.

```{r explore_2_b, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, include = debug_var, results = FALSE}
# Creating crosstab
crosstab_preHyp <- framingham_df %>%
  select(currentSmoker, prevalentHyp)

# Contingency table
crosstab_preHyp %>%
  table()

# Viewing crosstab
View(crosstab_preHyp)
```

```{r explore_2_b2, echo = TRUE, message = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Summarising of smoking status in relation to sysBP
crosstab_preHyp %>%
  summary_factorlist(
    dependent = "prevalentHyp", explanatory = "currentSmoker",
    column = FALSE, total_col = TRUE
  )
```

The summary statistics show that the prevalence of hypertension is higher in
people who do not smoke (37.2%) than in those who do (27.1%).

## 3.
As an automated approach to create the tables which is utilized, and no manual
data checking was conducted, the `drop_na` method is used to remove missing
values from the dataset.

# Developing the analysis plan

## 1. 
### a. 
I plan to answer the question about the risk of heart disease with a riskratio 
test. The null hypothesis is that the risk of heart disease (binary outcome of 
"Yes" or "No") is the same for smokers and non-smokers, which is a binary / 
categorical variable. The alternative hypothesis is that the risk of heart
disease is different for smokers and non-smokers. I will use a significance level
of 0.05.

### b. 
For answering the question of association of CHD and age a wilcox test will be
used. The null hypothesis is that the risk of heart disease is not dependent on age.
Therefore the alternative hypothesis is it appears differently with changing age 
groups. Again a significance level of 0.05 will be used.

## 2.
### a.
In this case several tests will be used. The null hypothesis is that the mean
systolic blood pressure is the same for smokers and non-smokers. The alternative
hypothesis is that the mean systolic blood pressure is different for smokers and
non-smokers. A significance level of 0.05 is used.

### b.
A Fisher excat test will be used to compare the prevalence of hypertension between
smokers and non-smokers. The null hypothesis is that the prevalence of hypertension
is the same for smokers and non-smokers. The alternative hypothesis is that the 
prevalence of hypertension is different for smokers and non-smokers. The same 
significance level as for the other analyses is used (0.05).

### 3
As the amount of data categories is complex, a automated approach was chosen to
create the tables which shows associations with a significance level of 0.01. The
null hypothesis is always that the risk factor is not associated with the 
occurrence of CHD. The alternative hypothesis is that it is.

# Investigating the assumptions

## 1.
### a. 
In this case, the assumption of normal distribution is not relevant, as it is 
the distribution of a discrete variable. The riskratio test will be used.

```{r assumptions_1_a, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Checking assumption
subset_framingham <- framingham_df %>%
  drop_na(currentSmoker) %>%
  sample_n(1000)

# Distribution of currentSmoker
p0 <- subset_framingham %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = currentSmoker)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., fill = anyCHD)) +
  labs(title = "Figure A1: Current Smoker",
       subtitle = "in relation to the occurrence of any Coronary Heart Disease",
       x = "Current Smoker", y = "Proportion",
       caption = "Data source: Framingham Heart Study")
p0

# Saving the plot
ggsave(p0, file = here("figures/", "Plot_A1.png"))

# Cleaning up the environment
rm(subset_framingham)
```

### b. 
The assumption of normal distribution for age will be tested with a histogram
and a Shapiro-Wilk test.

```{r assumptions_1_b, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Creating sample dataset
subset_age <-
  crosstab_age %>%
  drop_na(age) %>%
  sample_n(1000)

# Checking distribution of age (also for normality)
p1 <- subset_age %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density))) +
  geom_density(aes(y = after_stat(density))) + 
  labs(title = "Figure A2: Age",
       subtitle = "Distribution",
       x = "Age", y = "Density",
       caption = "Data source: Framingham Heart Study")
p1

# Saving the plot
ggsave(p1, file = here("figures/", "Plot_A2.png"))

# Shapiro-Wilk test
subset_age %>%
  pull(age) %>%
  shapiro.test()

# Showing histogram with of age in relation to `anyCHD`
p2 <- subset_age %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count), fill = ..density..), bins = 20) +
  labs(title = "Figure A3: Age distribution",
       subtitle = "in relation to the occurrence of any coronary heart disease",
       x = "Age", y = "Count",
       caption = "Data source: Framingham Heart Study") +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(anyCHD))
p2

# Saving the plot
ggsave(p2, file = here("figures/", "Plot_A3.png"))
```

Trusting the appearance of the histograms, showing rise on the left of the graph,
and the Shapiro-Wilk test with a p-value of less than 0.05, we assume that the age 
variable is not normally distributed. Considering that, the use of parametric tests 
like t-tests is not recommended.

```{r assumptions_1_b2, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Checking age_cat
p3 <- crosstab_age_cat %>%
  mutate(anyCHD = fct_rev(anyCHD)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age_cat, fill = anyCHD)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Figure A4: Age categories",
       subtitle = "in relation to the occurrence of any coronary heart disease",
       x = "Age category", y = "Proportion",
       caption = "Data source: Framingham Heart Study") +
  theme_minimal()
p3

# Saving the plot
ggsave(p3, file = here("figures/", "Plot_A4.png"))
```

The barplot shows that the proportion of individuals with any coronary heart or
without in the two age categories. It is showing that the proportion of individuals 
with CHD is higher in the 60-79 age category than in the 40-59 age category.

## 2.
### a.
The assumption of normal distribution for systolic blood pressure will be tested.

```{r assumptions_2_a, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Creating sampple dataset
subset_sysBP <- crosstab_sysBP %>%
  drop_na(sysBP) %>%
  sample_n(1000)

# Checking distribution of sysBP (also for normality)
p4 <- subset_sysBP %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sysBP)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density))) +
  geom_density(aes(y = after_stat(density))) +
  labs(title = "Figure A5: systolic blood pressure",
       subtitle = "Distribution in relation to smoking status",
       x = "Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)", y = "Denstity",
       caption = "Data source: Framingham Heart Study") +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(currentSmoker))
p4

# Saving the plot
ggsave(p4, file = here("figures/", "Plot_A5.png"))

# Performing Shapiro-Wilk test
subset_sysBP %>%
  pull(sysBP) %>%
  shapiro.test()
```

The p-value is very small, suggesting that the systolic blood pressure variable 
is not normally distributed. This means that we cannot use a parametric test 
like the t-test.
 
### b.

Here the assumption of normal distribution is not relevant, as it is 
the distribution of a discrete variable. The Fisher excat test will be used.

```{r assumptions_2_b, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Checking distribution of prevalentHyp
p5 <- crosstab_preHyp %>%
  mutate(prevalentHyp = fct_rev(prevalentHyp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = currentSmoker, fill = prevalentHyp)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Figure A6: Prevalence of hypertension",
       subtitle = "in relation to smoking status",
       x = "Smoking status", y = "Proportion",
       caption = "Data source: Framingham Heart Study") +
  theme_minimal()
p5

# Save the plot
ggsave(p5, file = here("figures/", "Plot_A6.png"))
```

## 3.
The assumption of normal distribution for continuous variables is tested 
through the Shapiro-Wilk test. The assumption of normal distribution for
categorical variables is not relevant.

# Carry out the analysis

## 1.
### a. 
The riskratio test is used to compare the risk of heart disease between
smokers and non-smokers. The test is performed using the `epitab` function from
the `epitools` package. The result is a risk ratio and a 95% confidence interval.

```{r analysis_1_a, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Calculating relative risk
framingham_df %>%
  select(currentSmoker, anyCHD) %>%
  table() %>%
  epitab(., method = "riskratio", rev = "columns")
```

### b. 
The Wilcoxon rank sum test is used to compare the median age of individuals
with and without any coronary heart disease. Also the t-.test is used to compare
the mean age that were calculated before.

```{r analysis_1_b, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Performing t-test (is this parametric test valid?
# as age is NOT normally distributed!!!)
crosstab_age %>%
  t.test(age ~ anyCHD, data = .)

# Performing wilcox-test (non-parametric test, as age is NOT normally distributed)
# age in relation to anyCHD
crosstab_age %>%
  wilcox.test(age ~ anyCHD, data = ., conf.int = TRUE)

# Cleaning up the environment
rm(crosstab_age)
```

Now the riskratio is calculated for the two age categories (40 - 59 and 60 - 79),
as the oddsratio.

```{r analysis_1_b2, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Relative risk
crosstab_age_cat %>%
  mutate(age_cat = fct_relevel(age_cat, "60-79")) %>%
  table() %>%
  epitab(., method = "riskratio", rev = "columns")

# Odds ratios
crosstab_age_cat %>%
  mutate(age_cat = fct_relevel(age_cat, "60-79")) %>%
  table() %>%
  epitab(., method = "oddsratio", rev = "columns")

# Cleaning up the environment
rm(crosstab_age, crosstab_age_cat, subset_age)
```

## 2.
### a.
Several tests are conducted. First the Chi-square test is used. As the distribution
of the systolic blood pressure is not normally distributed, the Wilcoxon rank sum
was used to confirm these results. Finally the linear regression is used to 
verify the outcome.

```{r analysis_2_a, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Performing Chi-squared test
crosstab_sysBP %>%
  table() %>%
  chisq.test()

# Performing Wilcoxon rank sum test (non-parametric test,
# as `sysBP` is NOT normally distributed)
crosstab_sysBP %>%
  wilcox.test(sysBP ~ currentSmoker, data = ., conf.int = TRUE)

# Lineare Regression
crosstab_sysBP %>%
  lm(sysBP ~ currentSmoker, data = .) %>%
  summary()

# Cleaning up the environment
rm(crosstab_sysBP, subset_sysBP)
```

### b.

The Fisher exact test is used to compare the prevalence of hypertension between
smokers and non-smokers.

```{r analysis_2_b, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Performing Fisher exact test
crosstab_preHyp %>%
  table() %>%
  fisher.test()

# Cleaning up the environment
rm(crosstab_preHyp)
```

## 3.

The automated approach is used to create the tables which shows associations with
a significance level of 0.01.

```{r analysis_3, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
# Looping through the risk factors with Chi-square test
# total cholesterol, smoking status, agecategory, systolic blood pressure,
# BMI, and prevalence of hypertension
risk_factors <- list("totChol", "currentSmoker", "age_cat", "sysBP", "BMI",
                     "prevalentHyp")

# Creating empty list to store results
significance_tb <- list()

# Looping through the risk factors
for (risk_factor in risk_factors) {
  # Looping through both sexes and both gender
  for (sex_var in list("female", "male", c("female", "male"))) {
    # Creating crosstab for each risk factor
    crosstab <- framingham_df %>%
      mutate(age_cat = cut(age,
        breaks = c(39, 59, 79),
        labels = c("40-59", "60-79")
      )) %>%
      drop_na(all_of(risk_factor)) %>%
      select(sex, all_of(risk_factor), anyCHD)

    # Setting Chi-square test for categorical variables
    if (class(crosstab[[risk_factor]]) == "factor") {
      test_type <- "chisq.test"
    }

    # Tests for continuous variables
    else { # nolint
      # Testing for normal distribution
      norm_dist <- crosstab %>%
        pull(all_of(risk_factor)) %>%
        shapiro.test()

      # T-test for continuous variables normally distributed
      if (norm_dist$p.value > 0.01) {
        test_type <- "t.test"
      }

      # Wilcoxon test for continuous variables, not normally distributed
      else { # nolint
        test_type <- "wilcox.test"
      }
    }

    # Performing the test
    result <- suppressWarnings({
      crosstab %>%
        filter(sex %in% sex_var) %>%
        select(anyCHD, all_of(risk_factor)) %>%
        table() %>%
        get(test_type)()

    # Cleaning up the environment
    rm(crosstab)

# Interpretation

## 1.
### a. 
The relative risk of occurrence of any coronary heart disease given the smoking
attribute show a slightly decreases risk factor if the individual is a smoker.
With a lower and upper confidence interval of 0.955 and 1.028, which includes 1,
there is no significant difference in the risk of occurrence of any coronary heart.
Also the p-value of 0.64 is greater than 0.05, suggesting no significant
relationship between the variables. This was already expected by the contingency
table and the barplot which didn't show any differences in both groups.

### b. 
The Wilcoxon rank sum test results show a significant difference in the median
age of individuals with and without any coronary heart disease. With a small p-value 
less than 0.05, we see a significant difference in the median age
of individuals with and without any coronary heart disease. The confidence
interval of -5 and -3 (0 not included) further supports this conclusion, as there 
seems to be a difference of around 4 years that persons with the disease are older,
than these without the disease. After that the relative risk for the two age
categories was calculated. Here a significant increase by 74,26% in the risk for 
the 60-79 age category can be seen. With a lower and upper confidence
interval of 1.54 and 1.97, which does not include 1, there is a
significant difference in the risk of occurrence of any coronary heart. Also the
p-value is less than 0.05, suggesting a significant relationship.
The odds ratio of occurrence of any coronary heart disease given the age category
attribute indicates an increase in the chance by two if the individual is in
the 60-79 age category. With a lower and upper confidence interval of 1.74
and 2.4 (which not included), there is a significant difference in
opportunity of the occurrence of any coronary heart. Significance is expected 
with a p-value of less than 0.05.

## 2.
### a.
The p-value of 0.007 is less than 0.05, suggesting a significant relationship
between the variables through the Chi-squared test. That means it can be concluded 
that the mean systolic  blood pressure of individuals who are smokers and those 
who are not is significantly different. 
As of non normal distribution of the systolic blood pressure, 
the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to confirm these results. It produced a 
pmuch smaller p-value, giving a stronger proof of a significant difference. 
The confidence interval of 4 and 6.5 further supports this conclusion, as this
range is not including 0 and is narrow. There seems to be a difference of 
5 mmHg, meaning that non-smokers have a 5 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure 
than non-smokers.
The linear regression result show a significant difference in the mean systolic
blood pressure of individuals who are smokers and those who are not. With a very 
small p-value, there is significance. The coefficient of -6 further supports 
this conclusion, as it indicates that smokers have a lower systolic blood pressure 
by 6 mmHg.

### b.
The p-value is less than 0.05, suggesting a significant relationship
between the variables. This means that the odds of having hypertension are
significantly different between individuals who smoke and those who do not.
The odds ratio of 0.63 indicates that the odds of having hypertension are
37% lower for individuals who smoke compared to those who do not smoke. The
95% confidence interval of 0.55 and 0.71 further supports this
conclusion, as it does not include 1, indicating a significant difference.

## 3.
Smoking is surprisingly not a significant risk factor for the occurrence of any 
coronary heart disease for male persons of the Framingham Heart Study. All other 
risk factors show a significant impact on the risk of attaining any coronary heart
disease.

# Conclusion

Smoking is not a significant risk factor for the occurrence of any coronary heart.
That is unexpected as the literature suggests that smoking is a significant risk
for diffrent diseases like coronary heart disease [@Smoking_CDC].

On the other hand, the Framingham Heart Study data shows significant impact of
all other variables on the risk of attaining any coronary heart disease.
